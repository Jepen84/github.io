           Afgang Typeface Family
            <br/>
            <br/>
    
        This typeface was initiated as part of a visual identity proposal for a festival celebrating Artists’ Books. The final typeface was to be, sort of a black sheep among traditional book typefaces, portraying the rebellious ideals on which the Artists Book genre builds.
<br/>
                <br/>
        The object was to challenge typographical con- ventions and to see how far you could push a book-typeface before it would become too noisy and disturbing for the readers flow of reading.The final typeface ended up being a transitional almost postmodern typeface seeking inspiration in a wide range of typefaces from very different times in type-history, both conceptually weirder stuff, like the work of Frederic William Goudy and František Štorm and more conventional work like that of Victor Lardent/Stanley Morison and Robert Slimbach.
