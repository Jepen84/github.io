        Crisis
            <br/>
            <br/>
    
        Screen printed posters and visual work for the graphic design course exhibition at Kunsthøjskolen Holbæk, in the spring of 2018. 
<br/>
                <br/>
       The overall theme for the graphic design exhibition was CRISIS. The students were asked to look at the term Crisis and work with a topic, theme, story or method of production they themselves found related to the word crisis.  The students were encouraged to break away from graphic design in its tradional sense, and think of the assignment as one of visual communication, and use whatever medium and format they thought relevant in the communication of their individual interpretation of the topic.
